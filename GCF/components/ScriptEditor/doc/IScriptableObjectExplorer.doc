access the scriptable object explorer.

The following code snippet shows how you can get hold of the scriptable objects 
explorer.

\code
QString objName;
GCF::AbstractComponent* seComp = 0;
QObject* obj = findObject("IScriptableObjectExplorer", objName, &seComp);
if(obj)
{
    IScriptableObjectExplorer* scriptEditorExplorer = qobject_cast<IScriptableObjectExplorer*>(obj);
    // now make use of the scriptEditorExplorer pointer to issue calls
    // into the Script Editor explorer.
}
\endcode
