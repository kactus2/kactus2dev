\ingroup propertyeditorcomp
\interface IPropertyEditor IPropertyEditor
\brief Provides access to the property editor widget

This is the main interface to the property editor component. It shows the properties of
a QObject by making use of 

\li Qt's Q_PROPERTY() mechanism and
\li IEditableProperties interface (if-any)

The best way to use a property editor within your components would be as follows

\code
void MyComponent::creationAnnounced()
{
    // ...

    // Fetch and store a reference to the property editor in this 
    // function
    QString name;
    GCF::AbstractComponent* comp = 0;   
    QObject* obj = findObject("IPropertyEditor", name, &comp);
    if(obj)
    {
        this->m_propertyEditor = qobject_cast<IPropertyEditor*>(obj);
        GCF::AbstractComponent::addDependency(this, comp);
    }
    
    // ...
}

void MyComponent::someFunction()
{
    // ...
    
    // Use the property editor to show properties
    if(this->m_propertyEditor)
        this->m_propertyEditor->setObject( objectPtr );
        
    // ...
}
\endcode

/**
\fn virtual void IPropertyEditor::setObject(QObject* object, bool recursive=false) = 0

Shows the properties of the object at \c object. If the \c recursive flag is set to true; 
then the properties of the child objects are also shown in the property editor.
*/

/**
\fn virtual QObject* IPropertyEditor::object() = 0

Returns the object whose properties are being shown by the property editor
*/

/**
\fn virtual int IPropertyEditor::propertyCount() = 0

Returns the number of properties that are currently being shown by the property editor.
*/

/**
\fn virtual IProperty* IPropertyEditor::property(int index) = 0

Returns the property at \c index.
*/

/**
\fn virtual void IPropertyEditor::setEditorFactory(IValueEditorFactory* factory) = 0

Sets the value editor factory to use while editing properties.
*/

/**
\fn virtual IValueEditorFactory* IPropertyEditor::editorFactory() = 0

Gets the value editor factory that is used while editing properties.
*/

/**
\fn virtual void IPropertyEditor::propertyValueChanged(QObject* obj, QString propName, QVariant oldVal, QVariant newVal) = 0

This function is implemented as a signal. It is emitted to announce the change in property value of
\c propName property in \c object. The changed value and previous value are also announced with this signal.
