\interface IProjectPart IProjectPart
\brief Through interface you can load and save your project part

A project part, as the name says it, is a part of a project. A single project
may consist of several parts. Each part is accessed, opened and saved through 
this interface. Information about all the parts are saved into a single XML
document.

You can implement this interface in any of the exposed objects in your component
to load and save information about your project part.

/**
\fn virtual QString IProjectPart::projectPartID() = 0

Must be implemented to returns a unique identifier for your project part. 
This ID will be written into the XML file to help differentiate between 
project parts.
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProjectPart::newProjectPart() = 0

Must be implemented to reset your project part's data structures and create
a new part.
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProjectPart::loadProjectPart(QDomDocument doc, QDomElement partE) = 0

Must be implemented to load information for this project part as contained 
under the XML element \c partE in XML document \c doc.
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProjectPart::initializeProjectPart() = 0

Must be implemented to initialize the project part. This method is called after this 
project part and all the other parts in the project have been loaded. You can use this
method to do some post-load initialization.
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProjectPart::saveProjectPart(QDomDocument doc, QDomElement partParentE) = 0

Must be implemented to save information about this project part into the XML document
\c doc and under the XML element \c partParentE
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProjectPart::closeProjectPart() = 0

Must be implemented to reset your project part's data structures and create
a new part.
*/

/**
\fn virtual void IProjectPart::projectPartModified() = 0

This method must be implemented as a signal. It must be emitted whenever your project
part has changed.
