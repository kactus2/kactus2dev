\defgroup projectmanagercomp Project Manager Component
\brief Manages a project in your application

Most applications will require load/save functionality to save the state
of the application or to save the document (or project as we call it) that 
is currently being edited.

With XML it is possible to store any type of data structure as long as their
values in the structure can be converted to strings and converted from 
strings. The \ref projectmanagercomp provides interfaces to help load and
save projects.

The \ref projectmanagercomp assumes that your document (or project) can be 
thought of as a collection of small entities called "Project Parts". All
of these parts can be aggregated into a "Project". The following block diagram
gives you a quick overview of this relation.

Project-part is an entity that can

\li Provide a unique string identifier to differentiate itself from
other project parts in the system
\li Reset itself, bringing its state back to that of a new part.
\li Save information about itself into an XML element
\li Load information about itself from an XML element
\li Can signal changes made to itself.

A project is an entity that 

\li Brings together one or more project parts
\li Orchestrates creation of new projects
\li Orchestrates saving of projects and
\li Orchestrates loading of projects

The \ref projectmanagercomp provides functionality of a Project, where as components 
can register one or more project parts. 

The IProject interface can be queried and used to access a project. Components can 
have one or more QObjects that implement the IProjectPart interface. Such objects
will automatically be picked up and registered with the \re projectmanagercomp. 
The project parts will be involved in loading and saving activity.

The \ref projectmanagercomp has the following default GUI-XML file.

\code
<component title="Project Manager" version="1.0" name="ProjectManagerComponent" >

 <object title="" name="controller" />
 <object scriptName="Project" title="Project" name="visProject" />
 
 <action title="New" shortcut="Ctrl+N" triggerSlot="ProjectManagerComponent.visProject::slotNewProject()" icon=":/ProjectManager/new.png" name="newProject" />
 <action title="Save" shortcut="Ctrl+S" triggerSlot="ProjectManagerComponent.visProject::slotSaveProject()" icon=":/ProjectManager/save.png" name="saveProject" />
 <action title="Open" shortcut="Ctrl+O" triggerSlot="ProjectManagerComponent.visProject::slotLoadProject()" icon=":/ProjectManager/open.png" name="loadProject" />
 <action title="Save As" shortcut="Ctrl+Shift+S" triggerSlot="ProjectManagerComponent.visProject::slotSaveProjectAs()" icon=":/ProjectManager/saveas.png" name="saveProjectAs" />
 <action title="Close" shortcut="Ctrl+W" triggerSlot="ProjectManagerComponent.visProject::slotCloseProject()" icon=":/ProjectManager/close.png" name="closeProject" />
 
 <group title="Project" icon=":/StdMainWindow/appIcon.png" name="projectMenu" before="MainWindowComponent.editGroup" >
  <groupitem actionName="ProjectManagerComponent.newProject" />
  <groupitem actionName="ProjectManagerComponent.saveProjectAs" />
  <groupitem actionName="ProjectManagerComponent.loadProject" colSpan="2" rowSpan="2" />
  <groupitem actionName="ProjectManagerComponent.saveProject" colSpan="2" rowSpan="2" />
 </group>
 
</component>

\endcode

As you can see, the \ref projectmanagercomp provides built-in functions for handling load/save/save as/new
UI semantics.
