returned file name will contain the absolute path of the file and its name.
*/

/**
\fn virtual QString IProjectExt::currentProjectFilePath() const = 0

Through this interface method you can fetch the complete path of the project file. The
returned path will contain the absolute path of the folder that contains the file.
*/

/**
\fn virtual QStringList IProjectExt::recentFilesList() const = 0
