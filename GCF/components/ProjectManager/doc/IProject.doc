\li Register/Unregister project parts. 
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProject::newProject() = 0

Through this method you can request closure of current project and creation of 
a new one. 
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProject::loadProject(QString projectFile) = 0

Through this method you can request that the current project be closed and
a saved project is loaded from \c projectFile
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProject::saveProject(QString projectFile) = 0

Through this method you can request that the current project be saved into
\c projectFile.
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProject::closeProject() = 0

Through this method you can request closure of current project and creation of 
a new one. 
*/

/**
\fn virtual bool IProject::isModified() = 0

Through this method you can find out if the project has been modified after it
was last saved.
*/

/**
\fn virtual void IProject::addProjectPart(IProjectPart* part) = 0

Registers a project part. 
*/

/**
\fn virtual void IProject::removeProjectPart(IProjectPart* part) = 0

Unregisters a project part. 
*/

/**
\fn virtual int IProject::projectPartCount() = 0

Returns the number of project parts in project.
*/

/**
\fn virtual IProjectPart* IProject::projectPart(int index) = 0

Returns the project part at \c index.
*/

/**
\fn virtual void IProject::projectModified(bool val) = 0

This signal is emitted when ever the project has been modified and/or saved.
If \c val is false, then the project was saved. If \c val is true, then the
project has been modified.
