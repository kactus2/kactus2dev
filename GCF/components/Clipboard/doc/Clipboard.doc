\defgroup clipboardcomponent Clipboard Component
\brief Provides a multi-context, list based clipboard component

QClipboard provides access to the system clipboard. The one and only
clipboard in the application can be accessed by making use of the
\ref QApplication::clipboard() method. This clipboard is sufficient if
you have only one context of copy/paste and only one item to store in
the clipboard. 

What if you wanted to store multiple data elements in the clipboard? 
And what if you wanted to store multiple-contexts of multiple data-elemnets
in the clipboard? QClipboard would not be suitable in such cases.

\todo Explain the clipboard component better with an example

To make use of the features provided by clipboard component, you have to query for
the IClipboard Interface from your component.

For Example:

\code
QString objName;
IComponent* clipboardComp = 0;
QObject* obj = findObject("IClipboard", objName, &clipboardComp);
if(obj)
{
    IClipboard* clipboard = qobject_cast<IClipboard*>(obj);
    // now make use of the clipboard pointer to issue calls
    // into the clipboard component
}
\endcode

The Clipboard component has the following default GUI-XML file.

\code

<component title="Clipboard component" name="ClipboardComponent" >
    
    <object name="controller" />
    <object name="clipboardModel" />
    <widget name="clipboardWidget" title="Clipboard" parentWidget="MainWindowComponent.leftDockArea" />
    
</component>

\endcode
