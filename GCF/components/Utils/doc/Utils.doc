\defgroup utilscomponent Utils Component
\brief Utils Component provides utility functions for applications.

It provides XML and Math utility functions as described in IXmlUtils and IMathUtils interfaces.

To make use of the features provided by Utility Component, you have to query for
the IXmlUtils or IMathUtils Interface from your component.

For Example:

\code
QString objName;
GCF::AbstractComponent* utilsComp = 0;
QObject* obj = findObject("IMathUtils", objName, &utilsComp);
if(obj)
{
    IMathUtils* mathUtils = qobject_cast<IMathUtils*>(obj);
    // now make use of the mathUtils pointer to issue calls
    // into the Utils component
}
\endcode
