\defgroup stdinterfaces Standard Interfaces
\brief Provides information about the standard interfaces in GCF

Standard interfaces are those that are available to all GCF 
applications. They are a part of GCF and they mean something 
within GCF.

For example the IContainer interface has to be implemented
by any QObject subclass that implements one or more interfaces.
This way it is possible to reach other interfaces from a given
interface.

\interface IContainer IContainer
\brief This interface provides access to the QObject that contains
one or more interfaces.

To understand the importance and need for IContainer interface, 
take a look at the class definition below.

\code
class Interface1 
{
public:
    virtual void interface1Method() = 0;
};
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(Interface1, "com.vcreatelogic.Interface1/1.0");

class Interface2
{
public:
    virtual void interface2Method() = 0;
};
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(Interface2, "com.vcreatelogic.Interface2/1.0");

class MyClass : public QObject, public Interface1, public Interface2
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_INTERFACES(Interface1 Interface2);

public:
    MyClass();
    ~MyClass();

    void interface1Method();
    void interface2Method();
};
\endcode

Instances of MyClass can be type-cast into Interface1 and Interface2
by making use of the qobject_cast casting operator. Take a look at the
code snippet below

\code
MyClass* obj = new MyClass;
Interface1* iface1 = qobject_cast<Interface1*>(obj);
Interface2* iface2 = qobject_cast<Interface2*>(obj);
\endcode

Suppose you have a method that accepts Interface1 as parameter, and
you want to find out if the object also has a Interface2 implementation;
how do you do that?

\code
void someFunction(Interface1* ifacePtr)
{
    Interface2* ifacePtr2 = qobject_cast<Interface1*>(ifacePtr);
    // WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
}
\endcode

There are some things wrong about the above casting mechanism

\li It is not possible to use qobject_cast casting operator on 
pointers that don't point to QObject.
\li It is not save to use dynamic_cast or reinterpret_cast on 
interfaces, to reach its parent.

To solve these problems, we can make use of the IContainer interface.
The IContainer interface, neccesiates implementations to provide
a containerObject() method. This method should return a pointer to 
the object that contains one or more interfaces.

If you require a class that implements your interface to be a QObject
then virtually inherit your interface from IContainer.

Let's revise our class definition as follows

\code
class Interface1 : virtual public IContainer
{
public:
    virtual void interface1Method() = 0;
};
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(Interface1, "com.vcreatelogic.Interface1/1.0");

class Interface2 : virtual public IContainer
{
public:
    virtual void interface2Method() = 0;
};
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(Interface2, "com.vcreatelogic.Interface2/1.0");

class MyClass : public QObject, public Interface1, public Interface2
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_INTERFACES(Interface1 Interface2);

public:
    MyClass();
    ~MyClass();

    QObject* containerObject() { return this; }
    void interface1Method();
    void interface2Method();
};
\endcode

With the above change we can now have casting done like this

\code
void someFunction(Interface1* ifacePtr)
{
    QObject* obj = ifacePtr->containerObject();
    Interface2* ifacePtr2 = qobject_cast<Interface2*>(obj);
}
\endcode

If you want to delete an object that contains a container interface,
you cannot use the delete operator on the interface pointer.
You will need to use delete on the container object.

Example:
\code
void someFunction(Interface1* ifacePtr)
{
    delete ifacePtr->containerObject();
}
\endcode

\note If an interface inherits from IContainer, it means that 
classes that implement the interface must implement IContainer.
This also means that classes that implement the interface have
to be inherited from QObject.
*/

/**
\fn virtual QObject* IContainer::containerObject() = 0

Throught this interface method you can obtain a pointer to the QObject
that contains this interface (and possibly others).

\ingroup stdinterfaces
\interface IQueryable IQueryable.h
\brief An interface that helps in reaching other interfaces from 
a given interface.

Sometimes in may happen that you have a class that implements 
one or more interfaces, but is not a QObject. For example 

\code
class Interface1 
{
public:
    virtual void interface1Method() = 0;
};

class Interface2
{
public:
    virtual void interface2Method() = 0;
};

class MyClass : public Interface1, public Interface2
{
public:
    MyClass();
    ~MyClass();

    void interface1Method();
    void interface2Method();
};
\endcode

Instances of MyClass can be type-cast into Interface1 and Interface2
by making use of the qobject_cast casting operator. Take a look at the
code snippet below

\code
MyClass* obj = new MyClass;
Interface1* iface1 = dynamic_cast<Interface1*>(obj);
Interface2* iface2 = dynamic_cast<Interface2*>(obj);
\endcode

Suppose you have a method that accepts Interface1 as parameter, and
you want to find out if the object also has a Interface2 implementation;
how do you do that?

\code
void someFunction(Interface1* ifacePtr)
{
    Interface2* ifacePtr2 = dynamic_cast<Interface1*>(ifacePtr);
    // WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
}
\endcode

To solve this problems, we can make use of the IQueryable interface.
While designing your applications, if you require a class, that 
implements your interface, not necessarily inherit from QObject; then 
virtually inherit your interface from IQueryable.

The IQueryable interface, requires classes to implement two methods

\code
virtual bool queryInterface(QString ifaceName, void** ifacePtr) = 0;
virtual bool destroySelf() = 0;
\endcode

These methods help in typecasting from one interface to another
by making use of the interface name. Implementation of queryInterface()
can be tricky sometimes. To help make the implementation easy, GCF
provides macros

\li GCF_DECLARE_QUERYABLE
\li GCF_BEGIN_QUERY_TABLE
\li GCF_IMPLEMENTS and
\li GCF_END_QUERY_TABLE

The use of above macros and IQueryable can be observed in the revised
class and interface definition below.

\code
class Interface1 : virtual public IQueryable
{
public:
    virtual void interface1Method() = 0;
};

class Interface2 : virtual public IContainer
{
public:
    virtual void interface2Method() = 0;
};

class MyClass : public Interface1, public Interface2
{
    GCF_DECLARE_QUERYABLE

public:
    MyClass();
    ~MyClass();

    void interface1Method();
    void interface2Method();
};

// In the implementation
GCF_BEGIN_QUERY_TABLE(MyClass)
    GCF_IMPLEMENTS(Interface1)
    GCF_IMPLEMENTS(Interface2)
GCF_END_QUERY_TABLE(MyClass)

\endcode

With the above change we can now have casting done like this

\code
void someFunction(Interface1* ifacePtr)
{
    Interface2* ifacePtr2 = 0;
    bool success = ifacePtr->queryInterface("Interface2", (void**)&ifacePtr2);
    if( success && ifacePtr2 )
    {
        // now we have ifacePtr2
    }
}
\endcode

If you want to delete an object that contains a queryable interface,
you cannot make use of the delete operator on ther interface pointer.
You will need to make use of the destroySelf() method from IQueryable.

Example:
\code
void someFunction(Interface1* ifacePtr)
{
    ifacePtr->destroySelf(); // now the object containing
                             // the interface is deleted
}
\endcode

\note If an interface inherits from IQueryable, it means that
any class that inherits it must contain the GCF_DECLARE_QUERYABLE
macro. In the implementation GCF_BEGIN_QUERY_TABLE/GCF_IMPLEMENTS/GCF_END_QUERY_TABLE
macros have to be used to describe all the interfaces implemented
by that class.

\interface IConfigurationDialogPageProvider IConfigurationDialogPageProvider.h
\brief Interface through which configuration dialog pages can be provided

GCF provides a built-in component called GCF::ConfigurationDialogComponent which provides
a dialog box called \ref CConfigurationDialog. The component and dialog box together 
look for implementations of IConfigurationDialogPageProvider interface in the entire application
and shows a configuration dialog like the one shown below

\image html configdialog.png

Pages to be shown in the configuration dialog box are queried from IConfigurationDialogPageProvider
implementations. When the user clicks Ok on the dialog box; the \ref savePage() method interface
method is called.

To use this interface in tandem with the \ref GCF::ConfigurationDialogComponent component, you
can use the code snippet below

\code
void MyClass::on_configDialogAction_triggered()
{
    GCF::ConfigurationDialogComponent component;
    component.initialize();
    // By the time the intialize() method returns the configuration 
    // dialog would have been shown and the user would have clicked
    // Ok or Cancel on the dialog box

\interface IComponentRemoteAccessControl IComponentRemoteAccessControl.h
\brief This interface helps control access to a component's objects by remote
applications

Allowing remote access to applications brings to the table unique security challenges. 
For example, we might not be interested in allowing remote access originating from a 
certain category of systems, we may not be interested in allowing a subset of an object's 
methods/properties/signals/slots to be accessed remotely.

Towards this, you can implement any one or both of the following interfaces

\li IComponentRemoteAccessControl 
\li IObjectRemoteAccessControl

The IComponentRemoteAccessControl interface can be implemented by GCF::AbstractComponent subclasses 
to control access to objects contained in it by remote applications.

Example:

\code
class MyComponent : public GCF::AbstractComponent, virtual public IComponentRemoteAccessControl
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_INTERFACES(IComponentRemoteAccessControl)

    // ...

    bool isAllowComponentAccess(GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) const {

        // Only allow applications from my LAN to access this component
        if( remoteApp->socket()->peerAddress().toString().startsWith("192") )
            return true;

        return false;
    }

    bool isAllowObjectAccess(QObject* object, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) const {

        // Since we have implemented isAllowComponentAccess(), remoteApp can be
        // assumed to be from the LAN
