    <h2>Other clock drivers editor</h2>
    <p>
      Other clock drivers-editor shows the clocks within the component
      that are not directly associated with a top-level port.  This
      kind of clocks could be i.e. virtual clocks or generated clocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock river has 5 mandatory parameters such as <b>name</b>.
      <b>Clock source</b> is optional and defines the physical path
      and name of the clock generation cell. E.g. a component
      instantiated in VHDL and its output, like 'i_clkGen/clk1'. The
      waveform of the clock signal has 4 parameters. Time units are
      either <strong>ps</strong> (picosecond) or <strong>ns</strong>
      (nanosecond).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Clock period</b> defines the length of one cycle of clock
      pulse, e.g. 10 ns. <b>Pulse offset</b> describes the time delay
      from start of the cycle to the first transition. <b>Pulse
      value</b> defines the logic value which the first transition is
      made to, either 0 or 1. <b>Pulse duration</b> specifies how long
      the value defined in pulse value is held, e.g. 5 ns.  <br><img

      Other clock drivers editor provides a context menu (right mouse
      button) with the following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Add new clock (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove clock (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
