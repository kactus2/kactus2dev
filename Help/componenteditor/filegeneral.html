      name</b> specifies e.g. a VHDL library where the VHDL-file will
      be compiled to. If it is <b>"only used as default"</b>, it can
      be overridden by another process. If check box is unticked, then
      this logical name cannot be overrriden.

      <b>command</b> and <b>flags</b> for this file. Flags can either
      <b>replace default flags</b> (e.g. those specified for this file
      type) in the build script or be appended to them. <b>Target
      name</b> specifies a path to the file that is derived from this
      file when build process is run.
