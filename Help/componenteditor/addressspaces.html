    <h2>Address spaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address spaces editor contains the summary of the address spaces
      of the component. This editor can be used to add and remove
      address spaces to the containing component. Editor enables user
      also to set the general information of an address space.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Address space</i> defines the addressable memory space that
      can be accessed via a <i>master interface</i>. In other words,
      it is the programmer's view to the rest of the system. <br/>Note
      that address space is actually instance-specific concepts (what
      other units are there and what are their addresses) than
      component-specific. Nevertheless, IP-XACT standard defines
      address space inside a component, although it is seldom a
      reusable thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Address space has a <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>.
      <b>Addressable unit size</b> specifies the number of bits each
      address increment contains, e.g. 8 bits or 32 bits. <b>Range</b>
      meanss the size of the address space expressed as addressable
      units. In other words, it is the number of separate
      addresses. <br/><b>Width</b> is the data width of a row in
      bits. It defines the maximum size for a single transfer.
      <b>Master interface binding</b> ties the address space to some
      master interface but this can also be left blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Address spaces editor contains a context menu providing following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Add new address space (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove address space (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
