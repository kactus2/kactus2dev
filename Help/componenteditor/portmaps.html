    <h2>Port maps editor</h2> 
    <p>
        User can map the <i>logical signals</i> of a bus interface to the physical <i>ports</i> of the component.
        The physical ports are located in the top table, while the logical signals and port maps are located in
        the bottom table.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Physical port filters</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Port name</b> allows regular expressions to filter ports not matching the given expression.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Direction</b> allows the selection of a port direction and filtering all the other ports with
            different directions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Connected ports can also be hidden through <b>Hide connected ports</b>. By default, this filter is on,
            but can be removed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Creating a port map</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Drag & Drop.</b> A <i>physical port</i> can be dragged over a <i>logical signal</i> to create a
            port map connecting the selected physical port to the selected logical signal. Multiple physical ports
            can be dragged simultaneously to the selected logical signal to create multiple port maps.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Selecting a port.</b> A <i>physical port</i> can be selected for the logical signal from the
            physical port column. This creates a port map connecting the selected physical port to the logical
            signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Context menu.</b> Right clicking on a logical port opens a context menu, through which it is
            possible to create a new port map. This port map can then be filled with the desired data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Auto connect.</b> Creates a single port map for each logical signal that does not have a port map.
            A suitable physical port is selected by matching the direction, size and the name of the logical signal
            to physical ports.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Removing a port map</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Context menu.</b> A <i>port map</i> can be removed throught the context menu. Right click on the
            selected port map to open the menu. From there, select remove port map.
            <br />Opening the context menu on a <i>logical signal</i> allows the removing of all the port maps
            connected to the logical signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Remove all.</b> Clicking the <i>Remove all</i> button removes all the port maps from this bus
            interface.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Port maps</h3>
    <p>
        The port maps table consists of both the <i>logical signals</i> and the <i>port maps</i> referencing
        logical signals. The table is constructed as a tree, where the port maps are child items of a logical
        signal. Values for columns with an f(x) symbol can be given as expressions.
        <br />If a logical signal has been referenced only was in the port maps of the bus interface, information
        of the port map is displayed on the same row as the logical signal.
        <br />If a single physical port is referenced in all the port maps referencing the logical signal, the
        physical port name is displayed on the same row as the logical signal. If multiple port maps referencing
        the same logical signal contain different physical ports, the name is displayed as [multiple].
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>logical signal</i> of a port map can be changed from the <b>logical port</b> column. This moves the
        selected port map from its current position to the selected logical signal.
        <br />The <i>physical port</i> can be changed from the <b>physical port</b> column.
    </p>
    <p>
        A port map can be defined by giving ranges for the logical and physical sides. These ranges determine how
        many and which bits are connected between the port and signal. These can be defined in the columns for the
        <b>logical left</b>, <b>logical right</b>, <b>physical left</b> and <b>physical right</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Requirement</b> informs the user of the port map requirement of the logical signal. The requirement is
        set in the abstraction abstraction definition of a bus definition, and cannot be edited here. The possible
        values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Illegal.</b> <i>Logical signal</i> may not be refereneced in a port map.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Required.</b> <i>Logical signal</i> must be referenced in a port map.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Optional.</b> The default value. Port maps can be created referencing the <i>logical signal</i>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Tie off</b> displays the possible logical tie off of the port map. A port map must contain either a
        reference to a physical port, or a logical tie off. The logical tie off indicates thate the physical
        connection for this logical port is the specified value.
    </p>

    <h4>Port maps context menu (right mouse button)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Expand all.</b> Show the port maps connected to each logical signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collapse all.</b> Hide the port maps connected to each logical signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Add port map</b> (logical signal / port map). Add a port map to the selected logical signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Remove all port maps</b> (logical signal). Remove all the port maps referencing the selected
            logical signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Remove port map</b> (port map). Remove the selected port map.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        The port maps tab of a bus interface editor is used to group the physical ports of the containing component
        to the logical signals listed in the associated abstraction definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lower table contains the <i>logical signals</i> that were defined in the associated
        <i>abstraction definition</i>. The upper table contains a list of the physical <i>ports</i> in the
        component. The bottom table displays the mappings between logical signals and physical ports. The mapped
        physical ports disappear from the physical ports table.
    </p>
	<p>
        The port directions are shown using the following icons:
        <ul>
            <li><img src="../images/control-180.png"></img>in</li>
            <li><img src="../images/control.png"></img>out</li>
            <li><img src="../images/control-dual.png">inout</img></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Picture below depicts how the physical ports between two component instances are connected through their
        bus interfaces.<br> <img src="../images/PortmapVisualization.png"
        alt="The association between physical ports and logical signals"><br> The physical ports of the component
        A are on the left and those of component B on the right. Logical signals are in the middle and the lines
        denote port mappings.  For example component A has mapped its port 'comm_out' to the logical signal 'COMM'
        and component B has mapped its port comm_in to it.  When user connects these interfaces together in a
        design, the physical ports get connected.
        <br>
        All ports of the component do not need to be mapped in the interface nor do all the logical signals of the
        abstraction definition need to be associated with a physical port. Abstraction definition defines the
        directions of the signals in different interface modes thus making it possible to validate connections so
        that two output ports are not accidentally connected to each other. In the figure above the abstraction
        definition could have defined the DATA signal to have direction out in master interfaces and in at slave
        interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        A vectored physical port can be sliced to connect only part of it by assigning left and right bounds in the
        mapping table. Picture below depicts how a part of the physical port can be connected.
