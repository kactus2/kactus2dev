    <h2>Memory map editor</h2>
    <p>
      Memory map editor can be used to edit the details of a <i>memory map</i>. The <b>name</b>,
      <b>display name</b> and a <b>description</b> contain identification information of a memory map.
      <br />The <b>address unit bits</b> [AUB] defines the number of data bits each address increment of the memory
      map contains.
      <br /><b>Remap state</b> identifies the name of the remap state for which the optional memory map elements
      are active. Memory maps are labeled with a default remap state, while memory remaps must be given a
      remap state (mandatory).
      <br />Memory map is defined for a <i>slave interface</i>. It defines what the masters can access in this
      component. Memory map is hierarchical.

    <h3>Address blocks table</h3>
    <p>
    <i>Address block</i> specifies a single contiguous block of
    memory, either a set of registers or a block of memory. (Moreover,
    IP-XACT allows defining <i>bank</i> or <i>subspaceMap</i>, but
    they are not yet supportted by Kactus (v2.1, March
    2013). <i>Registers</i> are inside address block and each
    register can have <i>bit fields</i>. <br> Address block has 5
    mandatory parameters: usage, name, base address, range, and width.
  </p>
    <p>
      <b>Usage</b> column is used to specify the usage of
      the address block. The possible values are:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Memory</i> specifies the address block as memory. Cannot
      include registers.</li>

      <li><i>Register</i> specifies the entire block to contain
      registers.</li>

      <li><i>Reserved</i> specifies the entire block as reserved for
      usage that is unknown to IP-XACT. Cannot include registers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Address block has a <b>name</b> and textual
      <b>description</b>. <br><b>Base address</b> specifies the
      starting address for the address block. It is expressed as
      <i>addressing units</i> as defined in the containing memory map,
      e.g. 8b or 32b. <br><b>Range</b> is also expressed as
      addressing units and specifies size of the block. Be careful
      that range is set greater or equal to the sum of all register
      sizes.<br><b>Width</b> is the data width in bits of a row in
      the address block. It sets the maximum allowed size of a single
      transfer and also defines the maximum size of a single
      register. Register can be smaller but not wider.
      </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column is used to specify the accessibility of the
      block. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this address block.</li>
        <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Read actions and the first write action may have an effect on this address
            block.</li>
        <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this address block.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Volatile</b>=true indicates that the stored value may
      change without master's write operation. For example, the timer
      value gets updated automatically and master must always issue a
      read to get the latest value.

      EXAMPLE. A simple IP could have 1 memory map, 1 address block
      inside it, and three 32-bit registers: ctrl, data_in, and
      data_out. Ctrl allows both read and write accesses, data_in is
      write-only, and data_out is read-only.  The lower part of ctrl
      register is divided into two 8-bit fields and designer can
      describe how they are used. The upper bits are not used. Data
      registers do not have field definitions.


      <br><br>Number of Addresss unit bits(AUB) os the memory map is
      set to 8 bits.  There are 3 registers with identical size (32b),
      Hence, ranger = 12 = 3 * 32/AU = 3 * 32/8 = 3 * 4. Let's assume
      base addr=0x100.  Since address block has 12 Bytes in total, it
      reserves the (byte) addresses 0x100-0x10B. It is good to set the
      width of the address block 32 b so that full register can be
      accessed at once. Smaller accesses (e.g. 1 byte at a time) are
      also allowed. <b>Memory maps visualization</b> is shown on the
