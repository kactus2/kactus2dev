    <h2>Memory map editor</h2>
    <p>
      Memory map editor can be used to edit the details of a <i>memory
      map</i> Memory map is defined for a <i>slave interface</i>. It
      defines what the masters can access in this component. Memory
      map is hiearchical.
    <ul>
      <li> slave port has memory map MM1
	<ul>
	  <li>address block A1
	    <ul>
	      <li>register R1, read/write...
		<ul>
		  <li>bit field f1, bits 7:0, command...</li>
		  <li>bit field f2...</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>register R2, write-only...</li>
	      <li>register R3, read-only...</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>address block A2...
	    <ul>
	      <li>memory m1, 16KB, read/write </li>

    <i>Address block</i> specifies a single contiguous block of
    memory, either a set of registers or a block of memory. (Moreover,
    IP-XACT allows defining <i>bank</i> or <i>subspaceMap</i>, but
    they are not yet supportted by Kactus v2.1, March
    2013)</i>. <i>Registers</i> are inside address block and each
    register can have <i>bit fields</i>. <br/> Address block has 5
    mandatory parameters: usage, name, base address, range, and width.
  </p>
    <p>
      <b>Usage</b> column is used to specify the usage of
      the address block. The possible values are:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Memory</i> specifies the address block as memory. Cannot include registers.</li>
      <li><i>Register</i> specifies the entire block to contain registers.</li>
      <li><i>Reserved</i> specifies the entire block as reserved for usage that is unknown to IP-XACT. Cannot include registers.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p>
      Address block has a <b>name</b> and textual
      <b>description</b>. <br/><b>Base address</b> specifies the
      starting address for the address block. It is expressed as
      <i>addressing units</i> as defined in the containing memory map,
      e.g. 8b or 32b. <br/><b>Range</b> is also expressed as
      addressing units and specifies size of the block. Be careful
      that range is set greater or equal to the sum of all register
      sizes.<br/><b>Width</b> is the data width in bits of a row in
      the address block. It sets the maximum allowed size of a single
      transfer and also defines the maximum size of a single
      register. Register can be smaller but not wider.
      </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column is used to specify the accessibility of the
      block. The possible values are:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Read-write</i></li>
      <li><i>Read-only</i></li>
      <li><i>Write-only</i></li>
      <li><i>Read-writeOnce</i></li>
      <li><i>writeOnce</i></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p>
      <b>Volatile</b>=true indicates that the stored value may
      change without master's write operation. For example, the timer
      value gets updated automatically and master must always issue a
      read to get the latest value.
    </p>

      EXAMPLE. A simple IP could have 1 memory map, 1 address block
      inside it, and three 32-bit registers: ctrl, data_in, and
      data_out. Ctrl allows both read and write accesses, data_in is
      write-only, and data_out is read-only.  The lower part of ctrl
      register is divided into two 8-bit fields and designer can
      describe how they are used. The upper bits are not used. Data
      registers do not have field definitions.


      <br/><br/>Number of Addresss unit bits(AUB) os the memory map is
      set to 8 bits.  There are 3 registers with identical size (32b),
      Hence, ranger = 12 = 3 * 32/AU = 3 * 32/8 = 3 * 4. Let's assume
      base addr=0x100.  Since address block has 12 Bytes in total, it
      reserves the (byte) addresses 0x100-0x10B. It is good to set the
      width of the address block 32 b so that full register can be
      accessed at once. Smaller accesses (e.g. 1 byte at a time) are
      also allowed. <b>Memory maps visualization</b> is shown on the
      right. User can expand and minimize parts of it by clicking the
      plus (+) and minus (-) signs.<br/>
