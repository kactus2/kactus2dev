    <h2>General editor</h2>
    <p>
      General editor contains the general information of a
      <i>component</i>, such as <i>description</i>.
    </p>
    <p>      
      <i>VLNV</i>-identifier and the file path to the xml-file are
      shown on top. These fields cannot be modified after
      creation. Changes require that the component must be saved as
      new component with new VLNV. <br/>

    <p>
      <b>Kactus attributes</b> help to classify and categorize one's
      IPs. They are Kactus2-specific extension to the IP-XACT standard
      and describe the level (single IP vs. system), implementation
      style, and whether modification is allowed.  <br/><img

      <b>Description</b> text box can be used to store a textual
      description of the component.

    <p>
      <b>XML header</b> shows and allows editing the comment lines in
      the beginning of XML file, i.e. those inside tags &lt!-- and
      --&gt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Component preview</b> box on the bottom displays how the
      component will look like when instantiated in a design. The
      preview displays the <i>bus interfaces</i> of the component and
      also the <i>ports</i> that are marked as <i>ad-hoc</i>.
