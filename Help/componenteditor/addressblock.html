    <h2>Address block editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address block editor is used to edit the details of an address block and the possible registers in it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>name</b>, <b>display name</b> and a <b>description</b> contain identification information
      of the address block. Name is mandatory and must be unique within all the address blocks of the 
      containing memory map.<br />
      <b>Usage</b> is a mandatory value to specify the usage of the address block and may 
      have one of the following values:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Register</i> The address block range may contain registers.</li>
        <li><i>Memory</i> The address block range is ROM, RAM or write-only memory as defined by 
        <i>access</i> and shall not contain registers.</li>
        <li><i>Reserved</i> The address block is reserved for other usage and shall not contain registers.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Base address</b> is mandatory and specifies the starting address for the address block expressed in 
      address units. Base address can be given as a SystemVerilog expression.<br />
      <b>Range</b> is mandatory and specifies the size of the block expressed in address units. 
      Range can be given as a SystemVerilog expression.<br />
      <b>Width</b> is mandatory and defines the data width of a row in the address block in bits.
      Width can be given as a SystemVerilog expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Access</b> specifies the accessability of the address block. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this address block.</li>
        <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Read actions and the first write action may have an effect on this address
            block.</li>
        <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this address block.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> indicates whether the stored value may change without the master's write operation.
    </p>
    <h3>Registers table</h3>
    <p>
      The register table enables the user to define registers for the address block. Each row
      represents a single register. 
    </p>
    </p>
      Each register has a unique <b>name</b> and an optional <b>description</b> for details.<br>
      <b>Offset</b> is mandatory and specifies the location of the register from the start of the 
      containing address block expressed as number of addressing units. The actual address of the 
      register is the sum of address block's base address and the register offset. E.g. if the base 
      address is 0x100 and the register offset is 0x4, the register's address is 0x104.
      Offset can be given as a SystemVerilog expression.<br>
      <b>Size</b> is mandatory and defines the number of data bits the register contains. Size must be less or
      equal to the <i>width</i> of the containing address block. Size can be given as a SystemVerilog
       expression.<br>
      <b>Dimension</b> assigns an array dimension to the register. The register will be repeated in the
      address block as many times as indicated by the <i>dimension</i> value. Dimension 0 means
      that the register is not an array and will appear exactly once. Dimension can be given as a 
      SystemVerilog expression.<br>
      <b>Volatile</b> indicates whether the register value may change without a
      write operation to it, i.e. by an interrupt event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column specifies the accessibility of the register. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register.</li>
      <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
      <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
      <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register. Only the
          first write transaction, after an event that caused the reset value of the register to be loaded, may
          affet the contents of the register, and read transactions return a value related to the values in the
          register.</li>
      <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of the register.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Reset value</b> defines register's value on reset and
      <b>Reset mask</b> defines the bits of the register that have a known reset value. 
      Bit value of 1 means that the corresponding bit has a known reset value whereas 0 means that 
      the value is unknown. Both use SystemVerilog syntax for binary values e.g.
      'b1011, 4'b1011, and 4'b10_11 are all valid values. The numberof bits must be equal to 
      the register <i>size</i>.
    </p>
	<p>
      <img src="../images/appicon.png" alt="kactus logo"/><b>Is present</b> is a Kactus2 extension for
      enabling/disabling a register presence in an address block. Value 1 indicates that the register is present
      in the address block whereas value 0 marks the register to be treated as if it did not exist.
      Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression, but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.<br />
