    <h2>Bus interfaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      The bus interfaces editor displays a summary of the bus
      interfaces of a component. <i>Bus interface</i> groups
      <i>ports</i> together to form an interface that fulfills
      requirements for a bus protocol. Connecting two matching
      interfaces means connecting multiple ports (up to tens or even
      hundreds of bits) together very easily. This editor is used to
      add and remove bus interfaces in a component
    </p>
    <p>
      Bus interface hass a mandatory <b>name</b> and optional textual
      <b>description</b>.
      <br>
      <b>Bus definition</b> and <b>abstraction definition</b> columns
      are not editable here. They display the <i>VLNV</i>-identifiers of the
      IP-XACT documents that define qualities of the interface. These
      fields must be set in the bus interface-specific editor.
    </p>
    <p> 
      <b>Interface mode</b> has 7 different choices (3 modes and 2
      flavors of each, plus 1 extra):
    </p>
    <dl>     
      <dt>1. <strong>Master</strong></dt> <dd>- initiates
	transactions, like write or read. May have an <i>address
	  space</i> which captures the programmer's view of the system
      </dd>
      
      <dt>2. <strong>Slave</strong></dt> <dd>- responds to
	transactions, e.g. accepts the written value or provides the
	read value. May have a <i>memory map</i>, i.e. information about
	the accessible registers inside this component</dd>
      
      <dt>3. <strong>System</strong></dt>
      <dd>- can be used for some interfaces that do not fit into the
	master or slave category.<br><br></dd>
      
      <dt>4-6. <strong>Mirrored master, mirrored slave, mirrored system</strong></dt>
      
      <dd>- are the <i>mirrored</i> versions, i.e.  they have the same
	(or similar) ports as the normal interfaces but the directions
	of the ports are reversed. <br>For example, if <i>master</i>
	interface has data <i>input</i>, then <i>mirrored master</i> has
	data as <i>output</i>.  It is not allowed to connect to mirrored
	interfaces together. <br>The main usage of mirrored interfaces
	is at bus intercconects, such as AMBA AHB/APB or HIBI, since
	they allow constructing a memory map of the whole system,
	whereas regular IP components mainly utilize direct interfaces.
	<br><br></dd>
      
      <dt>7. <strong>Monitor</strong></dt>
      
      <dd>- is an interface that can be used for verification
	process. It gathers data from other interfaces,
	i.e. non-intrusive observation and hence all logical port are
	<i>inputs</i></dd>
    </dl>

    <p> 
      IP-XACT allows 3 kinds of connections
    </p>
    <ol>
      
      <li><i>direct</i>: master to slave. Point-to-point
	connection. Complex cases require using bus interconnect
	component containing <i>bridge(s)</i>, such as multillayer AHB
	bus. </li>
      
      <li><i>direct-mirrored</i>: master to mirrored master, mirrored
	slave to slave, system to mirrored system. Point-to-point
	connection. Complex cases require using bus interconnect
	component containing <i>channel(s)</i> </li>
      
      <li><i>monitor</i>: any type except monitor to monitor. Many
	monitors can be connected to single interface</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>    
      E.g. IP_0 writes data through its master interfce to
      interconnect's mirrored master interface. On the receiving side,
      interconnect's mirrored slave interface writes the data to
      IP_1's slave interface.
