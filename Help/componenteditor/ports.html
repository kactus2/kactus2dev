    <h2>Ports editor</h2>
    <p>
      Ports editor provides a table containing all the <i>ports</i> of
      a component. This editor is used to add, remove and edit the
      ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each port has 5 mandatory parameters.  <b>Port name</b> is a
      uniques identifier and must match the name of the port in the
      implementation language. For example, the ports listed in the
      VHDL entity declaration are listed here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Direction</b> has four options:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>in</strong> for input ports.</li>
      <li><strong>out</strong> for output ports.</li>
      <li><strong>inout</strong> for bidirectional and tri-state
      ports.</li>
      <li><strong>phantom</strong> for ports that exist on the IP-XACT
      component but not on the implementation.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p>
      <b>Left</b> and <b>right bounds</b> define the indices of a
      vectored port. The <b>width</b> of the port is <i>left bound -
      right bound + 1</i>, e.g. 3 downto 0 requires 4 bits. In case of
      scalar ports the <i>left bound = right bound</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The port <b>type</b> is optional. Typical values In VHDL are
      'std_logic' for scalar ports (i.e. 1 bit) and and
      'std_logic_vector' for vectored ones (multibit). The <b>type
      definition</b> is a language specific reference to where the
      type is defined, e.g. package or header file. Type definition
      will be included at the beginnig of the generated top-level
      code. In VHDL, 'std_logic' types are defined in
      'IEEE.std_logic_1164.all' ('all' means that the whole package is
      included). In SystemC, the type definition is the include file
      name, e.g. 'systemc.h'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Default value</b> is useful since it assigns a value for an
      unconnected (input) port. This is used, for example, when
      generating a structural top-level VHDL for the hierarchical
      component where some input ports are not connected any other
      port in the design. Textual <b>description</b> is also optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ad-hoc</b> column is a Kactus2-specific extension which is used
      in the graphical user interface of a hierarchical design.<br/>

      <br/><br/> <img src="../images/adHocPorts.PNG" alt="Component
      instance with ad-Hoc ports"><br/> The component instances are
      drawn as rectangles and their external interfaces are drawn to
      the edges of the rectangle. There are different symbols for
      different directions. The example instance in figure has 5
      <i>bus interfaces</i>: clk, led, rst_n, from_hibi and
      pkt_codec. Each interface includes 1 or multiple ports, and the
      interface definition has its own VLNV. Moreover, user can select
      that some ports are shown as <i>Ad-hoc</i>, e.g. if they are not
      necessarily associated in any bus interface.  Example figure
      displays 2 ad-hoc ports: rx_av_in and led_out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ports editor provides a context menu (right mouse button) that
      contains following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Add new port (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove port (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
