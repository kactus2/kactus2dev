    <h2>Address space editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address space editor can be used to edit the details of an
      address space within component.  <i>Address space</i> defines a
      logical address space seen by a master bus interface. It can be
      split into smaller <i>sgements</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left side are the editor fields that can be used to set
      the details of an address space.  The right side has a
      visualization displaying the address space in its current state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Address space has a <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>
      <b>Display name</b> can be more detailed or user-friendly than
      name, but usually only few words.
    <p>
    </p>
      The general group contains the same settings that can be set
      through the address spaces summary. <b>Addressable unit size</b>
      specifies the number of bits each address increment contains,
      e.g. 8 bits or 32 bits. <b>Range</b> is the size of the address
      space expressed as addressable units, i.e. the number of
      separate addresses. <br/><b>Width</b> is the data width of a row
      in bits. It defines the maximum size for a single transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Segments</b> editor can be used to describe portions of the
      address space, i.e. split it into smaller segments. Each segment
      has the starting <b>offset</b> address, range (size) as number
      of AUBs, and textual <b>description</b>. The visualization on
      the right side reacts to the changes and displays how the
      segments are situated in the address space. Mismatches, e.g. sum
      of segment ranges being greater than address block range, can be
      easily spotted from the visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Local memory map</b> is optional but some processors require
      specifying a memory map that is local to the component.  This
      consists of <b>Address blocks</b> similarly to the memory map of
      a slave interface. Hence, address blocks can contain either
      memory or regsiters, and registers can contain bit fields. Local
      memory map is useful for storing the programmer's view to
      interrupts registers, timers, and other local things. The
      overall address space is a concatenation of local memory map
      (e.g. timers) and the memory maps of other units (e.g. registers
      of accelerator A, registers of accelerator B etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameters editor can be used to define parameters for the
      address space. The editor is similar to the parameters editor
      with the exception that the scope of the parameters is limited
      to the containing address space.
    </p>
    <p>Tag <i>executableImage</i> is not supported yet. IP-XACT
    standard allows defining an executable software image to be loaded
    into a processors address space, and also the commands to build
    it.
