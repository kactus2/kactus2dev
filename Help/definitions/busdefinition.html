    <h2>Bus Definition</h2>
    <p>
        Bus definitions are a part of the IP-XACT and they are used to define bus connections
        in HW designs.

        <p>
            <b>Allow direct master-slave connection</b> defines if a master bus interface can be directly 
            connected to a slave bus interface. If unselected, a bus interface can be connected only to
            a mirrored bus interface of the same type e.g. master to mirrored-master.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Addressable bus</b> defines if the bus interfaces contain addressing information.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Max masters on bus</b> defines the maximum number of master bus interfaces connected to
            the bus. If unspecified, the number of masters is unbound.
        </p>

        <p>
           <b>Max slaves on bus</b> defines the maximum number of slaves bus interfaces connected to
            the bus. If unspecified, the number of slaves is unbound.
        </p>

        <p>

    <h2>Abstraction Definition</h2>
    <p>
        <p>
            An abstraction definition can also be linked with a bus definition to provide additional validation
            for bus connections. Abstraction definition defines what logical signals must be present in the bus
            interface in order for the bus connection with such abstraction definition to be valid. Logical
            signals have the following properties:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Name</b> is a mandatory unique identifier for the logical signal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Qualifier</b> is an optional indicator for what kind of information the the signal carries.
            It can have one of the following five values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>address</b> indicates that the signal carries address information.
            </li>
            <li><b>data</b> indicates that the signal carries data.
            </li>
            <li><b>clock</b> indicates that the signal is a repeating clock signal for the bus interface.
            </li>
            <li><b>reset</b> indicates that the signal is a reset signal for the bus interface and
            is used to set the interface into a know valid state.
            </li>
            <li><b>any</b> indicates that the signal may carry any information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Width</b> is an optional definition of the number of bits in the logical signal.
            If not specified, the number of bits in the connected physical port is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Default value</b> is an optional value that is applied when the logical signal is not
            connected in a connected bus interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Direction</b> is an optional restriction for the logical signal direction in the 
            connected bus interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Presence</b> is an optional restriction for the logical signal presence in a bus interface.
            It can have one of the following three values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>required</b> indicates that the logical signal must appear in the connected bus interface.
            </li>
            <li><b>illegal</b> indicates that the logical signal must not appear in the connected bus interface.
            </li>
            <li><b>optional</b> does not apply any restrictions. This is the default value.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Driver</b> is an optional setting for defining what kind of a driver the logical
            signal requires in a complete design. The possible values are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>any</b> indicates that any logical signal or value is valid for driving the signal. 
            This is the default value.
            </li>
            <li><b>clock</b> indicates that a repeating waveform is required.
            </li>
            <li><b>singleshot</b> indicates that a non-repeating waveform is required.
            </li>
            <li><b>none</b> indicates that no driver is required.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
