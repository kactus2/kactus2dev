    <h2>Bus Interface</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Bus Interfaces</b> provide the connection points for the components. The access
        details are defined within the containing component, but the connections are defined
        in the design. Only compatible bus interfaces can be connected. The bus interface
        mode is indicated using the following colors:

    </p>	<p>		Bus interfaces can be re-positioned by drag-dropping.	</p>
    <h3>Interface Editor</h3>
    <p>
        The Interface Editor shows the selected bus interface <b>bus definition</b>, <b>abstraction
        definition</b>, <b>name</b>, <b>interface mode</b> and <b>description</b> as
        defined in the containing component. They are only editable if the bus interface
        is a draft. Otherwise all changes must be made in the containing component.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Port maps</b> shows the mapping of logical ports on the bus to the physical ports
        in the containing component.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Exclude</b> can be set to exclude the logical port from the port maps of the
        bus interface within this design.
    </p>	    <p>        <b>Exclude</b> can be set to exclude the logical port from the port maps of the        bus interface within this design.    </p>
