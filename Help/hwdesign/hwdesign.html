The main part      shows the instances and connections graphically. Selecting one      of them, shows the associated parametes on panel on the      right. <br>The ribbon on top has icons for    </p>    <ul>      <li> <b>Generation</b>: create automatically e.g. VHDL, synthesis and      simulation scripts, and HTML documentation.</li>      <li> <b>Diagram tools</b>: add columns, connections, IO pads, and      draft components; or convert a connection into an off-page      connection      </li>      <li> <b>View</b>: zoom in and out, select the shown windows and      parameters. </li>    </ul>    <p>      The design area is divided into typed <b>columns</b> in order to      create cleaner layouts. There are 4 column types: 'components',      'IO', 'buses', and 'custom'. Only matching items can be placed      on a column, but user can add new columns from the ribbon and      reorganize the existing ones freely. <br>Icon <b>Visible      windows</b> control what information is shown, e.g. library,      component preview, contecxt help and so on. Moreover, user can      reorganize the windows of Kactus and save the layout as      <b>workspace</b>. It is handy for quickly changing the layout      depending on purpose, e.g. design editing vs. component      packetization. Icon <b>Visibility control</b> allows selecting      whether design details, such as 'bus widths', are shown.    </p>    <p>      The panel on the right is divided into 5 windows, and 3 of them      are related to selected item (component instance, interface of a      component, connection between components). Two 2 panels related      to whole design are    <p>      <ol>      <li> <b>Ad-hoc visibility</b> controls how IOs in the graphical      block diagram looks like. By default, the design IO is shown      only as bus interfaces, but individual ports are also shown if      they marked as <b>ad-hoc</b>. This list is empty if there is no      IO.</li>      <li><b> Design configuration</b> is additional information about      an IP-XACT design. Each design can have multiple      configurations. Design configuration defines which is the      <b>active view</b> if component has many (such as simulation and      synthesis). Settings for generator chains or interface      abstractor are not yet implemented in Kactus</li>      </ol>    </body></html>
