    <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
    <p>
        A <i>design</i> describes the structure of a hardware component by instantiating other components from the 
        library and connecting them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The design area in the center is divided into typed columns to create cleaner
        layouts. There are four column types: 'Components', 'IO', 'Buses', and 'Custom'. Only items with matching
        types can be placed on a column. New columns can be created using the <b>Add Column</b> button in the 
        toolbar. The column and its allowed types can edited by double-clicking the column header. 
        The column order can be changed by drag-dropping the columns by the header.
    </p>
    <p>
        New <i>component instances</i> can be added by by drag-dropping <i>components</i> from
        the library into the design area. If dropped on an existing instance, the component will
		replace the exisiting instance. Similarly, two existing instances can be swapped by holding the ALT-key
		while drag-dropping one on the other.<br />
        <img src="../images/hierarchy.png"> A hierarchy icon is shown on the top right corner of the instance,
        if it has a design of its own. Double-clicking the instance opens the design. If the component
        does not have a design, the <b>Component Editor</b> is opened instead. Both options are also available
        by right-clicking the instance. All the <i>bus interfaces</i> in the component will be
        shown on the component instance and can be connected to other instances by creating an
        <i>interconnection</i> with the <b>Interconnection Tool</b>. 
        Instances can be copy-pasted within the design or into other designs.
        Selecting an item in the design shows more details in the windows on the right.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        The <i>Design</i> is configurable through a set of <i>parameters</i>. Parameters are name-value 
        pairs that can be referenced in e.g. <i>configurable element values</i> of the <i>component instances</i>
        to propagate the same value to every instance.
        For detailed information on parameters, see the parameters-section in the <b>Component Editor</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Ad-hoc Visibility</h3>
    <p>
        The Ad-hoc Visibility window is always visible in the design. It lists all the physical ports on the 
        selected component instance. If no instance is selected, the ports of the top-level component are
        listed instead. Setting the <b>ad-hoc</b> option for a port shows the individual port on the 
        component instance symbol or in the IO column, if it is a top-level port.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Configuration Details</h3>
    <p>
        The Design Configuration Details window is always visible in the design. A <i>design configuration</i> 
        contains additional information about an IP-XACT design. Each design can have multiple configurations. 
        Design configuration defines what are the <b>active views</b> of the component instances in the design.
        While not explicitly mandatory, each component instance used in the design should have an active view defined. 
        Connecting hierarchical draft bus interfaces to component instance bus interfaces require that an active view is 
        defined for that component instance.
    </p>
 

    <h3>Toolbar</h3>
   
    <p>
        <b>Generation</b> group has the tools for automatic generation of e.g. VHDL, Verilog, synthesis and 
        simulation scripts, and HTML documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Diagram tools</b> has all the design-specific actions including adding columns, connections and
        IO pads. Individual connections can be changed to off-page for cleaner diagrams with 
        <b>Toggle Off-Page Tool</b>. Preliminary components can be designed with the <b>Drafting Tool</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>View</b> has the tools for zooming in and out in the design. Zooming is also possible by holding
        the Ctrl-key while scrolling with the mouse wheel. <b>Visible Windows</b> controls what information
        is shown i.e. IP-XACT library, component preview, context help and design specific windows on the right.
        <b>Visibility control</b> allows selection whether design details, such as 'sticky notes', are shown 
        or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Workspaces</b> store the window layout and visibilty settings. It is handy for quickly changing the 
        layout depending on purpose, e.g. design editing vs. component packetization.
