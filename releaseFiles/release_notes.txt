  are packetized.

  Kactus2.



03/02/2012 1.2 (Build 396)
----------------------------------------------------

+ Added more detailed error reporting to the library's check integrity tool.

  when drag'n'dropping bus definitions from the library to a HW design.
+ Added dot graphics for visualizing connected bus intersections.
+ Added undercrossing graphics for visualizing bus intersections which are
  separate (i.e., not connected with each other).

- Fixed a crash when trying to remove files that were already moved on the
  disk.

* Kactus2 now saves the paths to library locations, not the direct paths
  to the XML files.
* Changed the plain IP-XACT view so that it is not reset when items
  are added or removed. Also the VLNV dialer now keeps it's contents
  regardless of the tree updates.
* New component properties are automatically named to 'unnamed' instead of
  having no name set.



19/01/2012 1.2 (Build 1)
----------------------------------------------------

+ Added possibility to select the name of the generated ModelSim file with
  an extension.
+ Added more thorough error printing for invalid/incomplete IP-XACT documents.
+ Added off-page connectors with rubber-band routing mode for often used
  interfaces/ports to achieve more readable designs by auto-hiding the rubber-
  band connections when they are not edited.
+ Added the ability to execute ModelSim generator through the component editor.
+ Added the possibility to select which C source file to open through the
  system design editor when right-clicking an application component.
+ Added the SW component type visualization in the component editor.
+ Kactus2 now remembers the filter settings that were set on a previous run
  of the program.

- Fixed the modelsim generator to use the correct syntax for vmake call.
- Fixed the inability to scroll the port map list when a bus interface is
  selected.
- Fixed the problem of opening the component editor by a double-click when a
  view is not selected.
- Fixed the out-of-sync problem of editing the same component simultaneously
  in the component editor and design editor.
- Fixed the crash when editing endpoints in the SW design editor.
- Fixed the regular expression problem in the MCAPI code assist.
- Fixed various small bugs in the system design editor.

* Made the protection feature more user-friendly by not always asking
  the confirmation whether the user wants to unlock the document.
* Simplified some list input boxes by removing explicit add/remove buttons.
* Reorganized the file information view in the component editor.
* Decreased the VLNV fields area on the docking windows.
* Moved the XML file writing order so that the general description is written
  at the beginning part of the file.
* Double-clicking an SW platform component in the platform stack editor now
  opens up the hierarchy if it exists and the component editor only if it
  does not exists (meaning a flat component).
* Removed the always repeating question of whether the user wants to add
  the generated VHDL-file to IP-XACT meta-data if it already exists there.
* Docking windows are now kept visible based on the user's selection of
  what windows to show/hide.

  view.

- Fixed the crash when scrolling a locked empty design.
- Fixed the error of changes being applied without saving when editing

  the document is locked.
* Appropriate editor windows on the right side are now automatically
  shown/hidden when an element is selected or deselected on a design.
* Configuration editor is now hidden for other editors than the HW design
  editor.
