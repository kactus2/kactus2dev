  segment in the memory map and address space editors.
+ Added a check box to enable/disable local memory map.
+ Added Browse button to New dialog pages in order to have more convenient
  directory selection if the automatically suggested location does not 
  suffice.
+ Added 'Select All' to the right-click context menu in design editors.
+ Added library filter selections to be saved as a part of the workspace.

- Fixed numerous bugs, both critical and non-critical ones.

  connection tool.
- Fixed API/COM interface deletion to also delete the underlying interface
  metadata from the SW component.
